Employee Retention

## Introduction
Employee attrition, also known as voluntary turnover, is a big problem for employers since it affects long-term growth goals in addition to productivity and work sustainability. The cost of replacing a person may easily reach a significant amount when we take into account the time required to interview and find a replacement, placement fees, sign-on incentives, and the loss of productivity for several months. Understanding why and when workers are most likely to depart can help you take steps to enhance retention and plan ahead for future hires. People analytics or people data science are terms used to describe this type of data science application. People analytics helps companies, and their human resource (HR) professionals minimize attrition by transforming the way they recruit and retain talent in the age of data science and big data analytics.

Through this project, we are aiming to get familiar with Apache Spark DataFrames. We are using Spark for data analysis, visualization, and modeling. We will look at patterns and trends among voluntary departures of employees to decide what can be done to the present workforce to help predict each employee’s risk of leaving.

## Responsibilities
Every team member will be involved in every stage of the project. Specific deliverables, on the other hand, will be owned by specific people. The data analysis and interpretation phases of the project will focus on building scripts to analyze and derive insights from the acquired data. The design and compilation of the final dataset will serve as the basis for wrapping up the project based on the findings. We will also work on the end-of-term presentation, summarizing the project's story, including the challenges and outcomes we encountered, as well as any relevant visualizations to assist explain the process. It will be a joint endeavor in the end, and we believe that this method will allow everyone to participate at every stage of the project.

## Data Origin
For our project, we are using a HR analytics dataset that is available on kaggle. The dataset has 14999 records and 10 attributes. Here we have features including the salary range, satisfaction level, no of projects, attrition, promotion in the last 5 years and so on.

## Use Cases
Global employers are realizing that data analytics may assist them in identifying employees who are most likely to leave. By appraising individual employees' value to the business and responding with appropriately designed reward programs and policies, strategic data-driven analysis of total rewards, employee profile data, and historical workforce trends provides deep insights into current and potential performance of individual employees.

Focusing on data to look for historical patterns and trends among voluntary departures might provide factors that can be used to the present workforce to help determine each employee's risk of leaving. Organizational positions, location, yearly income, incentive compensation, tenure, years to retirement, and other information are common examples. While individual data points, such as performance ratings, are useful at any moment in time, looking at all data points throughout time gives extra information.

The company can get a comprehensive picture of each employee's contribution to the business, across all data points, when it’s analyzed after categorizing employees. A retention risk analysis calculates a score for each employee that indicates their risk of voluntarily leaving the organization, using a statistically supported technique to discover the data elements most significant in forecasting whether an employee would terminate. Each organization's use of data to create relevant insights must be tailored to its culture, salary plans, incentive programs, and other factors.

A detailed analysis that is tailored to the needs of the business will give a holistic perspective of the organization and assist to clearly indicate where efforts should be focused on the path to reduce retention risk. By strategically utilizing data to get a deeper understanding of your business in these new ways, you will be better positioned to make educated decisions about how to retain personnel and give suitable compensation packages.

## Data Limitations & Potential Improvements
Our research and analysis are solely based on determining the main cause of employee turnover, and what can be done to promote employee retention. Potential improvements include doing further analysis to determine different means of incentives, and who and when is it best to reward an employee before it is too late.

## Conclusion
The usage of data analytics in this area may help businesses target high-risk and high-performing individuals for retention initiatives, and it can even help them make evidence-based decisions about incentive payments and equity grant distributions. In today's fast-changing and highly competitive world, this knowledge is vital. We believe that this project will provide us with a substantial chance to improve our pyspark skills.
